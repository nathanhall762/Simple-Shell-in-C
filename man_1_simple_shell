The simple shell is a command line interpreter that receives input from the user from the terminal.
It can be used in interactive mode, initiated by the executable
.Nm
or in non-interactive mode by piping in input 
(ex: 
.Ar echo "arg0 arg1 ..." | ./hsh
).

Standard Linux commands can be executed within the shell by the user in interactive mode by typing the command with arguments:
.br
.br
ex:
.Ar ls -l
.br
.br
Or by typing the command's full filepath:
.br
.br
ex:
.Ar /bin/ls -l
.Sh Built-In Commands
In addition to Linux commands from the environment, our simple shell contains a number of
built-in commands:
.br
.br
.Ar env
- prints list of environment variables to stdout
.br
.Ar exit
